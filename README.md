# City Wide Epidemic

## Overview

The City-Wide Epidemic Prediction and Hospital Bed Management System("locoheth" is the name of the application) is a full-scale solution
 built to streamline hospital operations and enhance resource management, especially during times of
 crisis like epidemics. The system targets key inefficiencies in hospitals, such as lengthy patient
 registration processes, overcrowded OPD queues, and improper bed allocation, offering a modern,
 technology-driven approach to solving these challenges.

  At its core, the system uses React and Node.js, allowing for a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly
 interface for both hospital staff and patients. It leverages MongoDB for database management,
 ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of patient data, medical records, and hospital resource
 information. Cloudinary is used to manage media files, ensuring the system can handle images and
 other media associated with patient records. Additionally, the system is built to handle large volumes
 of data, ensuring scalability as hospital needs grow. The architecture also supports secure data
 transmission, safeguarding sensitive patient information.

 One of the system's standout features is its use of machine learning to predict patient surges and
 potential epidemic outbreaks. By analyzing trends in patient data and external factors, the system can
 forecast increases in hospital admissions, helping hospitals prepare and allocate resources more
 efficiently. This predictive capability is crucial in preventing overcrowding and ensuring that patients
 receive timely care during peak periods. Additionally, it provides hospitals with early warnings,
 allowing them to adjust staffing levels and medical supplies accordingly. This proactive approach
 enhances overall hospital readiness and response in crisis situations(ML integration in the application should be 
improved more to have a expected outcome).


The system also offers real-time insights into hospital resources, such as bed availability, which allows
 for better management of patient flow. This ensures that beds are allocated based on need and
 availability, reducing wait times and improving overall patient care. The responsive design, built with
 Tailwind CSS, ensures that the system is accessible from various devices, making it easier for hospital
 staff to manage operations from anywhere.

 Overall, the City-Wide Epidemic Prediction and Hospital Bed Management System is a robust and
 innovative solution that addresses critical operational challenges in healthcare. It enhances both the
 patient experience and hospital efficiency, preparing healthcare facilities for crisis situations while
 improving day-to-day operations.

 ## Proposed System:

 The proposed system integrates real-time hospital management with machine learning for epidemic
 prediction, offering a web-based platform for dynamic hospital operations. It optimizes processes such
 as patient registration, OPD queue management, and bed allocation, ensuring real-time updates on
 hospital resources. By integrating machine learning models like LSTM for patient surge prediction
 and Random Forest for epidemic outbreak classification, the system enhances hospital preparedness
 and resource optimization. The scalable design allows for city-wide data sharing and collaboration
 among hospitals, ensuring coordinated response during health emergencies.
